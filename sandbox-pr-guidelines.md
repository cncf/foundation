# Sandbox Project Public Relations FAQ
## Updated: March 1

# Guidelines:
Please avoid using the word donated. The correct term for companies who have projects accepted into the CNCF Sandbox is “contributed”. Do not use the term “donated.” 
Please always mention “Sandbox” when talking about where the project will be housed. For example: [Company] has contributed [project] to the CNCF Sandbox. 
Please wait until a project is officially accepted into the CNCF Sandbox to make any public announcements as submissions are not always accepted and not every project application is considered in any given meeting. 

# Can our company announce that an open source project has been accepted to the CNCF Sandbox?
Yes, once the project is officially accepted into the CNCF Sandbox through the TOC vote, you are welcome to make your own announcement. However, CNCF as a policy does not provide any marketing or public relations support at this level. 

# Will someone from CNCF provide a quote for our press release or blog about a Sandbox project being contributed? 
Unfortunately, no, we do not provide any marketing or public relations support to Sandbox projects. However, you are welcome to reach out to a supporting CNCF TOC member if you like, however, they are under no obligation to provide a quote.

# Can we speak to the media about a project being accepted into the CNCF Sandbox? 
Yes - however -  please make sure that the journalists or influencers understand and report accurately that this project is entering the CNCF Sandbox. Instances where this is not reported accurately can result in CNCF requesting a correction from you or the outlet. 

# Will CNCF support our announcement on social media? 
We can retweet the announcement once from our @CloudNativeFdn handle, however in order to do so, the tweet will need to adhere to the following guidelines:
The tweet cannot come from a company handle
The tweet cannot tag any company handle or make reference to the company contributing the project

You can email pr@cncf.io with a request to retweet.  

# If we have questions about what is acceptable to say in our announcement, who can we reach out to? 
The CNCF PR team is more than happy to review your announcement or answer any questions you may have. You can contact the team at pr@cncf.io.
