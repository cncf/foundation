# CNCF Webinar Guidelines #

## Overview ##

CNCF webinars provide a cost-effective way to educate the community about trends and open source cloud native technologies. Webinars are offered to members, CNCF incubating and graduated projects, CNCF Ambassadors, and CNCF SIGs.

Please note: We are unable to share leads due to LF privacy policy.

## Webinar day and time ##

English language webinars are scheduled for every Tuesday 10am-11am Pacific Time, Wednesday 10am-11am Pacific Time, and Thursday 9am-10am Pacific Time.

Project, Ambassador, and SIG webinars are scheduled for Friday 10am - 11am Pacitic Time.

Chinese language webinars are typically scheduled for Wednesday or Thursday, 10am Beijing / Shanghai time. 

## Who can host a webinar ##

* Platinum and Gold Members can host 1 webinar per quarter.
* Silver members can host 1 webinar every 6 months.
* End user supporter members cannot hold a webinar.
* Graduated and incubating projects can hold a webinar twice a year. These webinars can communicate release launch details or provide a project update. The exception is Kubernetes who holds a webinar each quarter approximately 30 days after the release.
* Sandbox projects cannot hold a webinar. The exception is a CNCF member company can discuss their open source sandbox project during their allotted member webinar.
* CNCF Ambassadors can hold a webinar as it fits their schedule.
* CNCF SIGs can host 1 webinar a year.

* CNCF Member webinars will have "Member webinar" preceeding their webinar title.
* CNCF project webinars will have "Project webinar" preceeding their webinar title.
* CNCF Ambassador webinars will have "Ambassador webinar" preceeding their webinar title.
* CNCF SIG webinars will have "SIG webinar" preceeding their webinar title.

## Webinar content guidelines ##

* The simplest guideline is that webinar topics should be comparable to what would be accepted in a KubeCon + CloudNativeCon talk. 
* No straight product pitches. It is okay to do a comparison of part of the landscape (e.g., cloud native storage), but webinars should not be promotional. 
* Any platforms, tools, or technologies you are describing must be open source and work with CNCF projects.

## Webinar Calendar ##

The [webinar calendar] (https://calendly.com/cncf_webinars/cncf-webinar) is available for a 6-month period, for example 1H 2020 and 2H 2020. Approximately 6 weeks before the beginning of the time period, the webinar calendar is opened up for scheduling.

To choose a webinar date, go to the webinar calendar to view the available dates. Choose your preferred date. You will receive a calendar invite automatically via Calendly. The calendar invite will be updated with the company / project name, which confirms your webinar. When it gets closer to the webinar date, an email is sent confirming the webinar date is still good for you and outlines the next steps.

## How to pick a topic ##

* The purpose of the webinars is to educate the community and align your business with important thought-leadership topics. 
* The audience is interested in technical demos that help them solve problems and want to be able to ask your expert questions. 
* Our audience spans from developers, architects, CIOs, and CTOs. Topics should be tailored for which of those audiences you're trying to target. 
* We are emphasizing SEO optimization this year to drive more registrations and views after the fact, so please take some extra time to make sure your abstract is highlighting important keywords. We'll be making suggestions as well. 
* Top Performing Topics: Monitoring/Observability, CNCF Project Updates or Intros, CI/CD, Developer Experience, Deployment Strategies, Edge Computing, Security (ex. RBAC), ML/AI.

## Webinar Promotion & Prep Details ##

* Upon receipt of the abstract and the webinar being set up in Zoom, the hosting company will receive a link to the webinar registration page. The hosting company should use that link to promote the webinar.
* The webinar is added to the CNCF webinar page.
* CNCF promotes webinars via email, CNCF and KubeWeekly newsletters, and Twitter.
* Our most successful webinars are when the presenting company helps promote in addition to CNCF promotion. We are often able to double our attendance in these cases. 

## Webinar: Presentations ##
* 1 week prior to your webinar, send your webinar presentation to [Webinar](mailto:webinars@cncf.io). All presentations must be reviewed prior to the webinar.
* Logos:
  * Obsolete, low-res (i.e., pixelated), and malformatted logos are an epidemic among conference presentations. High-res logos of over 1000 cloud native projects, products, and companies are available in the cloud native landscape and the serverless and member landscapes. All logos are in the card mode and can be found with Cmd-F or Cntl-F from your browser. Note that all of these logos are stacked, not horizontal, and include the name. The logos are all the most current (or you can open a pull request if they’re not). 
  * Please see the CNCF style guide which covers things like abbreviating Kubernetes as K8s not K8 or K8S as well as the proper capitalization of projects like gRPC and containerd.

## Webinar Moderator ##

CNCF will provide a moderator for the webinar. The moderator is typically a CNCF ambassador or a CNCF staff member.

The moderator is responsible for covering the housekeeping items and helping the presenter manage the Q&A.


## Webinar: Day-Of Details ##

* Soundcheck: ½ hour before the webinar starts
* Live Webinar: Tuesday 10am-11am PT, Wednesday 10am-11am PT, Thursday 9am-10am PT, Friday 10am - 11am PT
