# CNCF Blog Guidelines #

## CNCF Blog Overview ##

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) blog serves as a channel for CNCF members, project maintainers of graduated and incubating projects, and ambassadors to share content with the community. 

The content on our blog consists of:
* Articles about graduated or incubating CNCF projects
* Technical content and how-to’s
* Stories about cloud native and CNCF project deployments
* Use cases and success stories
* Industry insight into cloud native adoption
* Reports from CNCF events 

Other topics are welcome, but it needs to have a direct link to the CNCF community.  

We accept content from CNCF members, project maintainers of graduated and incubating projects, and CNCF ambassadors.

## Content ##

The CNCF blog audience is developers, IT operators, and cloud native and open source enthusiasts. Keep this in mind as you develop your blog content.

Some things to think about:
* Posts from members must be vendor-neutral. The post may mention a vendor’s name as it relates to specific open source projects, project deployments, adoption paths, their hosting of an in-person event or speaking at an event, or other indications of meaningful participation in the community, but it shouldn’t feel like an advertisement for your services or company. We do not accept announcements or press releases to the CNCF blog.
* The most interesting posts are those that teach or show how to do something in a way others may not have thought of. 
* Blog posts that show hurdles that were encountered and explain how they were overcome often do very well as the community is looking to learn.
* How-to blogs and blogs with technical content are of interest to the developer audience in the community.
* Content on how to choose between different technologies and how to accommodate different legacy issues and cloud platforms is a good way to highlight your learnings and share with the community. 
* When showing upstreaming of a patch fixing an issue for others, link back to the Github issue, so readers can follow along. 
* Critical commentary or broad issues must be approached with sensitivity, professionalism, and tact in a way that is beneficial and positive for the community. 

Your post must be your content, but can be published elsewhere with a right to republish. All content should have an author and be published Creative Commons with Attribution.
