Cloud Native Computing Foundation (“CNCF”) Charter

The Linux Foundation

Effective Nov 6 2015 / Updated July 28 2021

#### 1. Mission of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

The Foundation’s mission is to make cloud native computing ubiquitous. The CNCF Cloud Native Definition v1.0 says:

Cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.

These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil.

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation seeks to drive adoption of this paradigm by fostering and sustaining an ecosystem of open source, vendor-neutral projects. We democratize state-of-the-art patterns to make these innovations accessible for everyone.

#### 2. Role of the CNCF.

The CNCF will serve a role in the open source community responsible for:

-	(a) Stewardship of the projects

	-	i. Ensuring that the technologies are available to the community and free of partisan influence

	-	ii. Ensure that the technologies’ brand (trademark and logo) is being cared for and used appropriately by members of the community, with a specific emphasis on uniform user experience and high levels of application compatibility

-	(b) Fostering the growth and evolution of the ecosystem

	-	i. Evaluating which additional technologies should be added to meet the vision of cloud native applications, and working to encourage the community to deliver them, and integrate them if and only if they advance the general agenda

	-	ii. Providing a way to foster common technical standards across the various pieces

-	(c) Promotion of the underlying technologies, and approach to application definition and management, including: events and conferences, marketing (SEM, direct marketing), training courses and developer certification

-	(d) Serve the community by making the technology accessible and reliable.

	-	i. The foundation seeks to offer up a fully integrated and qualified build of each of the constituent pieces, on a well-defined cadence across the reference architecture.

#### 3. Values.

The CNCF will strive to adhere to the following principles:

-	(a) Fast is better than slow. The foundation enables projects to progress at high velocity to support aggressive adoption by users.

-	(b) Open. The foundation is open and accessible, and operates independently of specific partisan interests. The foundation accepts all contributors based on the merit of their contributions, and the foundation’s technology must be available to all according to open source values. The technical community and its decisions shall be transparent.

-	(c) Fair. The foundation will avoid undue influence, bad behavior or “pay-to-play” decision-making.

-	(d) Strong technical identity. The foundation will achieve and maintain a high degree of its own technical identify that is shared across the projects.

-	(e) Clear boundaries. The foundation shall establish clear goals, and in some cases, what the non-goals of the foundation are to allow projects to effectively co-exist, and to help the ecosystem understand where to focus for new innovation.

-	(f) Scalable. Ability to support all scales of deployment, from small developer centric environments to the scale of enterprises and service providers. This implies that in some deployments some optional components may not be deployed, but the overall design and architecture should still be applicable.

-	(g) Platform agnostic. The specifications developed will not be platform specific such that they can be implemented on a variety of architectures and operating systems.

#### 4. Membership.

The CNCF shall be composed of Platinum, Silver, End-User and Academic and Non-Profit member participants.
