# Cloud Native Computing Foundation Slack Guidelines 

The [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) applies in all areas.
## Channel Spamming
Outside of the issue queues, this is our best communication medium for projects. Please keep your messages on topic for each channel, and please use the appropriate channel. Spamming channels with unsolicited or frequent messages is not allowed.

## Unwanted Solitication through Private Messages
Directly messaging users (unless the user has specifically requested the information) offering services, events, employment opportunities or freelance projects, is not allowed.   We have a #jobs channel where employment opportunities can be posted. 

### Unwanted Voice/Video Calling
Abuse of the voice/video calling features to call users without their permission is not allowed. Accidents sometimes happen, let the user know it was a mistake.  

## Escalating and/or Reporting a Problem
The CNCF Slack has an integrated tool for reporting issues. It may be accessed by clicking on "More actions", the "..." to the right of a message, and selecting Report message.

Slack guidelines patterned after the [HubSpot Developer Slack Code of Conduct](https://designers.hubspot.com/slack/code-of-conduct) and the [Kubernetes Slack Guidelines](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/communication/slack-guidelines.md)
