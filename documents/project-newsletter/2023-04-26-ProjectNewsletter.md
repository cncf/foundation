## KubeCon EU 2023 Retro Doc
Were you at KubeCon EU 2023? Do you have any feedback to make the event better OR want to gush at the Events team? 

Each KubeCon we’ve been collecting community feedback from a subset of folks, but we’d like to open it up to the entire maintainer community. 

Thanks in advance!

## CNCF Project Summary Table
A lesser-known part of the CNCF Landscape is the Project Summary Table. Part of the Landscape are fields that allow projects to define both typical and business use cases. 

Please check and see if your project already has these Use Case fields populated and if not, fill them in with some useful information. If you need help or a launching off point, please check KubeEdge’s Use Cases or contact projects@cncf.io 

## LFC Courses
The Linux Foundation has worked with the CNCF and created several courses specific to Open Source and inclusive communication. 
These are free for anyone to take so please feel free to sign up if you haven’t.

Term 03 - 2023 September - November
