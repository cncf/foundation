### New: Request meetings with Projects team 

One of the benefits of a CNCF Project is being able to get time on the CNCF’s calendar to discuss issues, concerns, or ideas your project has. To better execute on this offering, we’ve set up a Calendly to enable scheduling time with us!

Our door is always open, so feel free to schedule as needed! 


Note: When requesting, give us an idea of your discussion topics so we can ensure the right CNCF folks are in the room!

Ideally we’d like to hear from each of you at least once a year, so we may start reaching out to check on the weather in your project. :) 


Questions? 
Drop a note back to projects@cncf.io, we’re happy to help!
