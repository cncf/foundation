More details here: https://github.com/cncf/tag-contributor-strategy/tree/main/maintainers-circle#community-management 

## Devstats Affliation
Ever wondered where Devstats affiliations come from?

They’re in here: https://github.com/cncf/gitdm and openprofile.dev 
These may be useful to you! If you haven’t updated these recently, these affiliations are what Devstats looks for. 

## TOC Meeting with AdaLogics
If you’re curious about the goals + processes for security audits, the Technical Oversight Meeting for 6/20 might be useful for you! This is a recorded meeting with Adalogics and some project maintainers.

## Boost Your Project with Documentation Advice!
There’s a new Sheriff in town - maintaining repo access permissions on the CNCF org
When you want to grant access to your project repos to maintainers and collaborators, please submit a pull request to update the config.yaml file in the cncf/people repo.
Sheriff is being used to centralize repo access control for the CNCF org on GitHub. 
Sheriff runs once per hour, is launched from a Github Action on cncf/people, and it will undo any changes to repo permissions that are made via a repo's settings.yml file. 
Using Sheriff makes it easy for us to review who has access to all community repos in the CNCF org. Sheriff also allows us to structure our teams to reflect team roles and Sheriff teams are cross platform. 

## Mentoring
