## Design Suggestions  

(Please list any design direction that can be leveraged to create the initial concepts. I.e. Preferred color palette(s), whether the logo should be text-only or if it should also include an icon or mascot, should it be horizontal or stacked (or both), is there any information that we need to be aware of that will influence the design.)

## Creative Considerations & Distribution

The creative elements need to be flexible. The logo needs to be visible in single and multiple colors and scale so that it works at very small sizes. It will also be reproduced for printing, silkscreen, embroidery, and web.
