### Pre-submission checklist for maintainer updates (delete this if you're updating a different file)

_If you're adding a new maintainer to the CSV file, please review each of these actions as well:_

- [ ] You've provided a link to documentation where the project has approved the maintainer change.
- [ ] The maintainer has also created or updated their [LFX Individual Dashboard profile](https://openprofile.dev/).
- [ ] You've also sent an email with the addresses to <cncf-maintainer-changes@cncf.io> for access to Service Desk and mailing lists.
- [ ] Optional: You've also sent a PR with affiliation updates to [cncf/gitdm](https://github.com/cncf/gitdm?tab=readme-ov-file#cncf-gitdm).
