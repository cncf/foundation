        # Read before proceeding

        Before submitting this License Exception Request, please familiarize yourself with the following:

        - the CNCF IP Policy, from [section 11 of the CNCF Charter](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/charter.md#11-ip-policy), particularly 11(g)
        - the [CNCF Allowlist License Policy](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/allowed-third-party-license-policy.md#cncf-allowlist-license-policy)
        - the [HOWTO for submitting a license exception request](https://contribute.cncf.io/resources/how-to/submit-license-exception-request/)


        If the license for a particular component or dependency is one of the following, please also read the noted guidance before proceeding:


        - AGPL-3.0 (Affero GPL v3): [AGPL guidance](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/agpl-recommendations.md)
        - A component that has relicensed to a non-open source, "source available” license: [Source available guidance](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/source-available-recommendations.md)
        - Interactions generally with source available and other proprietary licenses: [Proprietary / source available guidance](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/proprietary-interactions-guidance.md)


        # When no exception is required

        **Please note**: No exception request is required if the component meets any of the following:


        - is entirely licensed under Apache-2.0 for code; or
        - is entirely licensed under CC-BY-4.0 for documentation; or
        - satisfies the [CNCF Allowlist License Policy](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/allowed-third-party-license-policy.md#cncf-allowlist-license-policy); or
        - is subject to a blanket exception that has been [granted previously](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/license-exceptions/README.md) or another previously-granted exception for an equivalent use case.
