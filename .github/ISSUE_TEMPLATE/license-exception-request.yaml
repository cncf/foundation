        ## Read Before Proceeding
        Before submitting this license exception request, please familiarize yourself with the following:
        - [CNCF IP Policy, from section 11 of the CNCF Charter, particularly 11(g)](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/license-exceptions/README.md)
        - [CNCF Allowlist License Policy](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/license-exceptions/README.md)
        - [HOWTO for submitting a license exception request](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/license-exceptions/README.md)
        
        If the license for a particular component or dependency is one of the following, please also read the noted guidance before proceeding:
        - **AGPL-3.0 (Affero GPL v3)**: [AGPL guidance](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/license-exceptions/README.md)
        - **A component that has relicensed to a non-open source, “source available” license**: [Source available guidance](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/license-exceptions/README.md)
        - **Interactions generally with source available and other proprietary licenses**: [Proprietary / source available guidance](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/license-exceptions/README.md)
        
        **When no exception is required**
        No exception request is required if the component meets any of the following:
        - is entirely licensed under Apache-2.0 for code; or
        - is entirely licensed under CC-BY-4.0 for documentation; or
        - satisfies the [CNCF Allowlist License Policy](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/license-exceptions/README.md); or
        - is subject to a blanket exception that has been granted previously ([see here](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/license-exceptions/README.md)) or another previously-granted exception for an equivalent use case.
