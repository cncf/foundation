### Contributor Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest of fostering
an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who contribute
through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation,
submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for
everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression,
sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age,
religion, or nationality.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery
* Personal attacks
* Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses,
 without explicit permission
* Other unethical or unprofessional conduct.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not
aligned to this Code of Conduct. By adopting this Code of Conduct, project maintainers
commit themselves to fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect
of managing this project. Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of
Conduct may be permanently removed from the project team.

This code of conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior in Kubernetes may be reported by contacting the [Kubernetes Code of Conduct Committee](https://git.k8s.io/community/committee-code-of-conduct) via <conduct@kubernetes.io>. For other projects, please contact the CNCF staff via <conduct@cncf.io>. You can expect a response within three business days. In matters that require an outside mediator, we have retained Mishi Choudhary (mishi@linux.com).

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant
(http://contributor-covenant.org), version 1.2.0, available at
http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/2/0/

### CNCF Events Code of Conduct

CNCF events are governed by the Linux Foundation [Code of Conduct](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/code-of-conduct/) available on the event page. This is designed to be compatible with the above policy and also includes more details on responding to incidents.
