### Contributor Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers in the CNCF community, and in the interest of fostering
an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who contribute
through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation,
submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in the CNCF community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression,
sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age,
religion, or nationality.

## Scope 

This code of conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

### CNCF Events

CNCF events, or events run by the Linux Foundation with professional events staff, are governed by the Linux Foundation [Events Code of Conduct](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/code-of-conduct/) available on the event page. This is designed to be used in conjunction with the CNCF Code of Conduct.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. 
By adopting this Code of Conduct, project maintainers commit themselves to fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect
of managing this project. 
Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of
Conduct may be permanently removed from the project team.

## Reporting 

For incidents occurring in the Kubernetes community, contact the [Kubernetes Code of Conduct Committee](https://git.k8s.io/community/committee-code-of-conduct) via <conduct@kubernetes.io>. You can expect a response within three business days.

For other projects, or for incidents that are project-agnostic or impact multiple CNCF projects, please contact the [CNCF Code of Conduct Committee](https://www.cncf.io/conduct/committee/) via conduct@cncf.io.  Alternatively, you can contact any of the individual members of the [CNCF Code of Conduct Committee](https://www.cncf.io/conduct/committee/) to submit your report. For more detailed instructions on how to submit a report, including how to submit a report anonymously, please see our [Incident Resolution Procedures](https://www.cncf.io/conduct/procedures/). You can expect a response within three business days.

## Enforcement 

The Kubernetes project's [Code of Conduct Committee](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/committee-code-of-conduct) enforces code of conduct issues for the Kubernetes project.

For all projects that do not have their own Code of Conduct Committee or other Code of Conduct incident responders, and for incidents that are project-agnostic or impact multiple projects, the [CNCF Code of Conduct Committee](https://www.cncf.io/conduct/committee/) enforces code of conduct issues. For more information, see our [Jurisdiction and Escalation Policy](https://www.cncf.io/conduct/jurisdiction/)

Both bodies try to resolve incidents without punishment, but may remove people from the project or CNCF communities at their discretion.
