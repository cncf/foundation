# Cloud Native Computing Foundation Slack Guidelines v1.0

The [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md) applies in all areas in addition to these rules:

## Channel Spamming

Outside of the issue queues, this is our best communication medium for projects. Please keep your messages on topic for each channel, and please use the appropriate channel. Spamming channels with unsolicited or frequent messages is not allowed.

## Unwanted Solicitation through Private Messages

Directly messaging users (unless the user has specifically requested the information) offering services, events, employment opportunities or freelance projects, is not allowed. We have a #jobs channel where employment opportunities can be posted on top of a online jobs board at [jobs.cncf.io](https://jobs.cncf.io)

### Unwanted Voice/Video Calling

Abuse of the voice/video calling features to call users without their permission is not allowed. Accidents sometimes happen, let the user know it was a mistake.  

## Reporting a Problem

The CNCF Slack has an integrated tool for reporting issues. It may be accessed by clicking on "More actions", the "..." to the right of a message, and selecting Report message.

Slack guidelines patterned after the [HubSpot Developer Slack Code of Conduct](https://designers.hubspot.com/slack/code-of-conduct) and the [Kubernetes Slack Guidelines](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/communication/slack-guidelines.md)

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member will not be tolerated.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, CNCF staff may take any action deemed appropriate, up to and including a warning or temporary 30 day ban, along with a permanent ban for repeated violation of these guidelines.
