### Tips for Getting Started & Engagement ###

* Bullets
  * break up long paragraphs of text 
  * help highlight key points, successes, and metrics
* Section headers
  * Clear, results-oriented headline, section headers (instead of stating Challenge, Solution, Results):
   * Add interest 
   * Provide context for the section (i.e. takeaways)
   * Help with SEO
