### Tips for Getting Started & Engagement ###

* Simple and concise is the way to go
* Less is more – 750 words or less is optimal, but no more than 1,000
* Bullets
  * break up long paragraphs of text 
  * help highlight key points, successes, and metrics
* Section headers
  * Clear, results-oriented headline, section headers (instead of stating Challenge, Solution, Results):
   * Add interest 
   * Provide context for the section (i.e. takeaways)
   * Help with SEO
   * Tip: ChatGPT is great for help
* Visuals and architecture diagrams (when applicable) add interest and help tell your story
  * Ensure they are hi-res
* Feature individual voices
  * Please use the active voice in CNCF case studies. More information on active vs passive voices can be [found here](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/active-vs-passive-voice/) 
* Conversational and honest: avoid jargon-heavy corporate speak
  * All CNCF publications use "open source" and "cloud native" as the proper style
  * Projects use different styles of capitalization. Reference the [graduated and incubating project listing](https://www.cncf.io/projects/%5d) to confirm
* User-centric: highlight the real-world experience of engineers or decision-makers
* Outcome-driven: focus on measurable impacts and lessons learned
* Mention contributions, bug reports, or participation in working groups or KubeCon and other relevant meetups, KCDs, events, and talks.
  * Each CNCF project has a different style for capitalization. Make sure you use the correct one by
