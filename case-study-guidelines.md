# CNCF End User Case Study Guidelines #

## Overview ##

Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) end user case studies help elevate the technical conversations to business objectives and challenges. This program features real-world use cases and the impact CNCF project and cloud native technologies are having on end users’ businesses. The case studies build narratives around specific metrics that reflect the positive as a resource for companies considering adopting cloud native technologies.

## Requirements ##
Each case study requires an interview with one or more team members, to be conducted by phone or in person. This takes approximately an hour.

Topics covered include:
* The previous solution and its shortcomings
* Reasons for choosing cloud native technologies
* Any engineering work by the organization to implement the technologies
* The quantifiable impact cloud native has had
* Challenges encountered along the way
* Best practices and advice
* What’s next

The case studies are then written from the interview and shared with the end user for review, fact-checking, and any necessary approvals prior to publication. It is also shared with any communications, legal, and marketing teams, as needed.

Case studies are approximately 800 words long.

## Sample questions ##
* Please tell us about your organization and its mission.
* What is your role at the company?
* What problem were you looking to solve?
* What legacy systems and cloud platforms were involved?
* Tell us about your evaluation process. Were other technologies considered? Was the existence of CNCF an important factor?
* What engineering work was required to make these technologies work for your organization?
* What other CNCF projects are you using or considering?
* What quantifiable impact has cloud native had on your organization and/or development teams? (e.g. increased uptime/availability; increased developer productivity; faster time to value; time savings; capex and opex savings; customer satisfaction)
* What have been the technology and business results of your cloud native approach?
* What’s next on the cloud native road map for your organization?
* What advice do you have for other companies thinking about going cloud native?
* Why is cloud native such a business imperative these days?

## Sample Case Study: Spotify ##
An Early Adopter of Containers, [Spotify Is Migrating from Homegrown Orchestration to Kubernetes](https://www.cncf.io/case-study/spotify/)

An early adopter of microservices and Docker, Spotify had containerized microservices running across its fleet of VMs with a homegrown container orchestration system.

Kubernetes was a nice compliment to their homegrown system, so the migration to Kubernetes and other CNCF projects went smoothly. Spotify is using Kubernetes, Envoy, and gRPC.

Results:
* CPU utilization improved 2-3x
* Services creation went from an hour to seconds or minutes
* Spotify has thousands of microservices in production, 150+ running on Kubernetes.


## Who can be featured in a case study? ##

Case studies need to be about an end user working with CNCF incubating or graduated projects. We are working to create case studies for each of these projects, as well as covering a diverse range of industries and geographic locations.

If you are a CNCF member and have customers with interesting use cases, you can suggest them for a case study. The resulting case study would be about your customer’s use case, and we would also be able to include some details about how you helped with the implementation.

## Promotion ##
The case study is published on [cncf.io](https://www.cncf.io/newsroom/case-studies/) and, in some cases, the project website.
CNCF markets the case studies online, through social media, blog promotion, and the CNCF newsletter. In some cases, the case study will be shared via the project Twitter account. We ask that you share the case study on your platforms as well.

## To get started ##
To submit a case study for consideration, email the below information to casestudies@cncf.io.
* End user name
* End user location
* CNCF projects used
* A brief summary of the business issue, solution, and benefits realized by the end user
* End user contact: name, email address
* Key stakeholders from your organization, contact information, and approval process

## Summary ##
If you have any questions about the case study program, please email casestudies@cncf.io.
