# Project Journey Report

## Overview

A Project Journey Report is an in-depth analysis created by the CNCF to objectively evaluate the current state of a project and assess the impact CNCF has had on its development and growth. The report provides a comprehensive overview, including a detailed history of the project, its evolution over time, and a current snapshot of its status. Key metrics such as project velocity, community diversity, and levels of participation will also be included.
